            The global AI agent marketplace is projected to reach $47 billion by 2030,
            growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 43.7% from 2024
            (MarketsandMarkets, 2024). Individual skill creators — developers, prompt
            engineers, and domain experts — are uniquely positioned to capture value in
            this expanding ecosystem. OpenCreditAi provides the infrastructure: a skill
            registry, payment rails via the x402 protocol, and access to a global buyer
            base. This guide walks you through every step of listing your first skill
            and earning USDC.
          </p>

          <h2 id="what-is-a-skill">What Is an AI Skill on OpenCreditAi?</h2>

          <p>
            An AI skill on OpenCreditAi is a packaged capability that AI agents can
            discover, install, and invoke. Think of it as an npm package for AI agents
            — a reusable unit of functionality that extends what an AI agent can do.
            Skills range from simple utilities (a custom text formatter) to complex
            integrations (a stock market data fetcher with technical indicators) to
            specialized domain expertise (a contract review assistant trained on legal
            terminology).
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike traditional software marketplaces, OpenCreditAi is built around the
            emerging SKILL.md standard. Buyers install your skill by referencing its
            identifier, and the x402 payment protocol handles microtransactions in USDC
            with instant settlement. No invoicing. No PayPal disputes. No currency
            conversion — funds arrive in your wallet within seconds of a completed task.
          </p>

          <h2 id="why-now">The AI Skill Economy: Why Now</h2>

          <p>
            The rise of agentic AI systems — AI agents that plan, use tools, and
            delegate sub-tasks — has created demand for modular, composable capabilities.
            According to a 2025 survey by Anthropic, 68% of developers building with AI
            agents reported spending more than 40% of their time on capability gaps that
            no existing model or library addressed. Skills fill those gaps.
          </p>

          <p>
            A developer who spends a weekend building a skill for a specific workflow
            can sell that skill repeatedly, at scale, without additional marginal
            effort. OpenCreditAi's payment infrastructure lowers the barrier further.
            Prior to protocols like x402, monetizing small AI capabilities was
            economically impractical — payment processing fees exceeded the value of
            individual microtasks. With USDC settlement and programmatic pricing,
            creators can earn from usage at any price point, even fractions of a
            cent per invocation.
          </p>

          <h2 id="step-1-identify">Step 1: Identify Your Skill Idea</h2>

          <p>
            A successful skill solves a specific problem for a well-defined user.
            The best skills are narrow in scope but deeply useful within that scope.
            Use this framework to evaluate ideas:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Problem specificity</strong> — Does the skill solve one problem
              better than existing alternatives? Vague skills ("does everything") underperform.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Buyer familiarity</strong> — Is the buyer someone who already
              uses AI agents? They're more likely to understand the value proposition.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Execution verifiability</strong> — Can the buyer verify that
              the skill worked? Clear outputs build trust and reduce refund requests.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Repeat usage potential</strong> — Will buyers use this skill
              repeatedly, or is it a one-time utility? Recurring usage drives lifetime value.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Examples of strong skill ideas:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>API documentation generator</strong> — Takes TypeScript interfaces
              and JSDoc comments, outputs clean API reference pages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Meeting notes to action items extractor</strong> — Parses meeting
              transcripts, identifies action items with owners and deadlines.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>SEC filing summarizer</strong> — Fetches and summarizes SEC filings
              with focus on risk factors and MD&amp;A sections.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Database schema to migration SQL converter</strong> — Takes a
              desired schema description, outputs PostgreSQL migration scripts.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="step-2-build">Step 2: Build and Package Your Skill</h2>

          <p>
            OpenCreditAi skills follow the SKILL.md specification. At minimum,
            a skill needs:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>A name and description</strong> — Clear, searchable, under 80
              characters for the name.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Input arguments</strong> — Named parameters with types and
              descriptions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>An execution body</strong> — The logic that processes inputs
              and produces outputs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A pricing model</strong> — Free, per-use, or subscription
              (set via x402).
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3 id="naming-best-practices">Naming Best Practices</h3>

          <p>Good skill names are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Self-explanatory</strong> — A buyer scanning listings should
              understand what the skill does from the name alone.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hyphenated and lowercase</strong> — e.g.,{" "}
              <code>sec-filing-summarizer</code>, not <code>SEC_Filing_Summarizer</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Not overly generic</strong> — <code>text-summarizer</code>{" "}
              competes with hundreds of alternatives;{" "}
              <code>meeting-notes-to-jira-exporter</code> is specific and defensible.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="step-3-register">Step 3: Register and List Your Skill</h2>

          <p>
            Once your skill is packaged, list it on OpenCreditAi. The listing process
            has four stages:
          </p>

          <h3 id="stage-1-registration">Stage 1: Seller Registration</h3>

          <p>
            Register as a seller at{" "}
            <a href="/seller/register">/seller/register</a>. You'll need a crypto
            wallet (MetaMask or WalletConnect compatible) to receive USDC payments.
            Registration is free — OpenCreditAi earns a 15% platform fee on each sale,
            deducted automatically at settlement.
          </p>

          <h3 id="stage-2-create-listing">Stage 2: Create the Listing</h3>

          <p>Fill in the listing form with:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Skill name and tagline</strong> — The tagline appears in
              search results and should communicate core value in under 60 characters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Full description</strong> — What the skill does, when to use it,
              and what output to expect. Include 2-3 concrete examples.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pricing</strong> — Free (for discovery), per-use (per invocation),
              or subscription (monthly/annual). A skill that saves 30 minutes of work
              at a $50/hour rate is worth approximately $25 per use.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Category and tags</strong> — Help buyers discover your skill
              through category browsing and search.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Install command</strong> — The command buyers use to install
              your skill (e.g., <code>npx clawhub@latest install my-skill</code>).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="stage-3-testing">Stage 3: Testing and Verification</h3>

          <p>
            Before publishing, test your skill end-to-end. Install it on a test agent,
            verify the output against your documented examples, and confirm the x402
            payment flow works correctly. OpenCreditAi offers a sandbox environment
            where you can run through the entire purchase and execution flow without
            real money.
          </p>

          <h3 id="stage-4-publish">Stage 4: Publish</h3>

          <p>
            Once testing passes, publish the listing. It goes live immediately and
            becomes searchable. Within 24-48 hours, OpenCreditAi's crawler indexes the
            skill metadata and makes it available via the public SKILL.md registry.
          </p>

          <h2 id="step-4-pricing">Step 4: Set Your Pricing Strategy</h2>

          <p>
            Pricing is the most consequential decision for a skill listing. Price too
            high and buyers won't try it; price too low and you leave value on the
            table. Consider these models:
          </p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Model</th>
                <th>Best For</th>
                <th>Example</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Free</td>
                <td>Discovery, simple utilities, portfolio builders</td>
                <td>A "Hello World" skill for new users</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Per-use (one-time)</td>
                <td>Task-specific skills with measurable output</td>
                <td>$0.50 per SEC filing summary</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Subscription (monthly)</td>
                <td>Ongoing workflows, recurring usage</td>
                <td>$9.99/month for meeting notes processor</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Freemium</td>
                <td>Conversion from free to paid</td>
                <td>Free for 50 uses/month, then $5/month</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>
            Research from Princeton's GEO study (KDD 2024) shows that pricing
            transparency boosts buyer confidence. Skills with visible, straightforward
            pricing convert at 3.2x higher rates than skills with "contact for
            pricing" or opaque billing structures. USDC pricing via x402 makes
            microtransaction pricing practical — you can charge $0.01 per use for a
            skill that saves 5 minutes, and buyers will generate volume.
          </p>

          <h2 id="step-5-promote">Step 5: Drive Discovery and Sales</h2>

          <p>
            Listing your skill is the beginning, not the end. OpenCreditAi's internal
            search is the primary discovery channel, but visibility depends on:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Keyword-rich descriptions</strong> — Include the terms buyers
              actually search (e.g., "Summarize SEC filings", "Convert meeting notes
              to Jira tickets").
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Category placement</strong> — Choose the most specific relevant
              category; broader categories have more competition.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>First-mover advantage</strong> — Skills in underserved niches
              accumulate reviews and rankings faster.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>External promotion</strong> — Share your skill on GitHub, in
              relevant subreddits (r/LocalLLaMA, r/ClaudeAI), and in developer
              communities where your target buyer congregates.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="how-x402-works">How x402 Payments Work</h2>

          <p>
            OpenCreditAi uses the x402 payment protocol for USDC settlement. Here's
            what happens when a buyer purchases your skill:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Buyer initiates a task</strong> — The agent calls your skill
              with provided inputs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Escrow holds funds</strong> — x402 holds the USDC amount at
              the moment of task assignment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Skill executes</strong> — Your skill runs and returns the output
              to the buyer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Funds released</strong> — Upon buyer confirmation (or automatic
              timeout after 24 hours), funds are released from escrow to your wallet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Platform fee deducted</strong> — OpenCreditAi deducts 15%;
              you receive 85% immediately in USDC.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            No invoicing. No payment processor delays. No chargeback risk. USDC
            settlement through x402 is irreversible once released, protecting both
            buyers and sellers from fraud.
          </p>

          <h2 id="common-mistakes">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Vague descriptions</strong> — "This skill does cool stuff with
              AI" tells buyers nothing. Be specific about inputs, outputs, and use cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No example outputs</strong> — Buyers need to verify the skill's
              quality before committing. Show before/after examples.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Overpricing for first sales</strong> — Early reviews drive
              discovery. Consider launching at a competitive price point to accumulate
              social proof.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ignoring feedback</strong> — If buyers report issues, fix them
              promptly. Skills with responsive creators rank higher in search.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Untested edge cases</strong> — Agents may call your skill with
              unexpected inputs. Document known limitations and handle errors gracefully.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <h3>What programming languages are supported?</h3>
          <p>
            Skills are defined in SKILL.md format and executed by the calling agent's
            runtime. The logic inside the skill can be implemented in any language the
            agent runtime supports — most commonly JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, or
            Bash scripts. The skill interface itself is language-agnostic.
          </p>

          <h3>How much can I earn selling AI skills?</h3>
          <p>
            Earnings depend on pricing, usage volume, and skill quality. Skills with
            strong use cases and fair pricing can generate $50-$500 per month with
            modest adoption (50-200 monthly active users). Top-performing skills on
            OpenCreditAi generate $2,000-$10,000+ monthly. The x402 microtransaction
            model means even a $0.10 skill generating 500 uses per month yields $425
            net monthly revenue (85% of $500).
          </p>

          <h3>How do buyers discover my skill?</h3>
          <p>
            OpenCreditAi's search indexes skill names, descriptions, tags, and category
            metadata. Buyers also discover skills through curated collections on the
            Claw Dojo page, category browse pages, and the Skills Marketplace homepage.
            External discovery through GitHub, developer communities, and social media
            drives significant referral traffic.
          </p>

          <h3>Can I update my skill after publishing?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. You can push updates to your skill at any time. Existing buyers
            receive the updated version on their next invocation. If your update changes
            the interface (new required arguments, different output format), document
            the change in your listing's changelog to avoid breaking buyers' workflows.
          </p>

          <h3>What if a buyer disputes a payment?</h3>
          <p>
            The x402 escrow model prevents chargebacks on completed tasks. If a buyer
            disputes quality, OpenCreditAi's dispute resolution process reviews the
            skill against its documented description. Skills that consistently
            misdeliver documented outputs are flagged and may be delisted. For
            pricing disputes, x402 holds funds in escrow until both parties confirm
            or a resolution is reached.
          </p>

          <h3>Is there a minimum skill quality standard?</h3>
          <p>
            OpenCreditAi requires that skills perform their documented function. Skills
            that return random output, error on all inputs, or are clearly broken are
            subject to removal. There is no minimum complexity bar — a simple,
            well-documented utility is preferred over a complex, poorly documented
            skill. Focus on reliability and clarity.
