            So you want to give your AI assistant some new tricks? You've come to the
            right place. This guide walks you through everything you need to know to
            get up and running with OpenCreditAi in under 10 minutes.
          </p>

          <h2>What Exactly is OpenCreditAi?</h2>
          <p>
            Think of OpenCreditAi as an app store—but instead of phone apps, these
            are skills for AI agents. Need your AI to analyze stock market data? There's
            a skill for that. Want automated content translation? We've got you covered.
            Whether you're building a trading bot, a customer support assistant, or a
            research tool, skills let you add specialized capabilities without building
            everything from scratch.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 1: Explore the Marketplace</h2>
          <p>
            Head over to <a href="/">OpenCreditAi</a> and take a look around. The
            homepage shows featured skills across different categories:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Finance & Trading</strong> — Stock analysis, forex signals, crypto
              predictions
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data & Analytics</strong> — Data processing, visualization, reports
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Marketing & Content</strong> — Copywriting, SEO, social media
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Development</strong> — Code assistance, debugging, API integration
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Not sure what you need? Use the search bar to type in whatever task you're
            trying to accomplish. Our search matches skill names, descriptions, and tags.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 2: Pick Your First Skill</h2>
          <p>
            Here's my recommendation for beginners: start with something free. This lets
            you understand how skills work without spending money. Look for the "Free"
            badge on skill cards—that means no cost to install.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you click on a skill, you'll see:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Description</strong> — What the skill actually does
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Price</strong> — Free or paid (if paid, you'll need to set up
              payment)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Install Command</strong> — The npm command to add it to your
              project
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Author</strong> — Who created it (some are verified creators)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Step 3: Install It (It's Just npm)</h2>
          <p>
            This is the easiest part. Every skill comes with an installation command that
            looks like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>npm install @opencreditai/[skill-name]</code>
          </pre>
          <p>Or if you prefer using npx:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>npx opencreditai install [skill-name]</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Just copy the command from the skill page, paste it into your terminal, and
            hit enter. That's it—the skill is now part of your project.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 4: Configure It</h2>
          <p>
            Most skills work right out of the box, but some need a bit of setup. Common
            requirements include:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>API Keys</strong> — Some skills connect to external services like
              weather APIs or financial data providers. You'll need to sign up for those
              services and paste your API key.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Environment Variables</strong> — Settings like API endpoints or
              configuration options usually go in your .env file.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Permissions</strong> — If the skill accesses files or makes
              network requests, you may need to explicitly allow those capabilities.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Don't worry—each skill's documentation explains exactly what you need. Look
            for the README file in the skill's package.
          </p>

          <h2>Quick Tips for New Users</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>One at a time</strong> — Install skills one by one. If something
              breaks, you'll know exactly which skill caused it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Check the version</strong> — Skills update frequently. Make sure
              you're using a version compatible with your setup.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Read reviews</strong> — Other users often leave helpful feedback
              about their experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Start simple</strong> — Don't try to build a complex multi-skill
              system on day one.
            </li>
          </ul>
