    items: [
      {
        question: 'What are OpenClawSkills?',
        answer: 'OpenClawSkills are modular capability extensions that enable your AI assistant (like Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, etc.) to perform specialized tasks. They follow the Agent Skill open standard developed by Anthropic, allowing AI assistants to interact with external services, automate workflows, and execute various professional tasks from code review to documentation generation and security analysis.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I install OpenClawSkills?',
        answer: 'Installing skills is simple. The easiest method is using ClawdHub CLI: run `npx clawdhub@latest install <skill-slug>` to install a specific skill. Alternatively, you can manually copy the skill folder to `~/.openclaw/skills/` (global) or `<project>/skills/` (project-level) directory.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Which AI agent frameworks are supported?',
        answer: 'OpenClawSkills supports all AI coding assistants that follow the Agent Skill standard, including Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Cursor, Aider, Windsurf, Zed, RooCode, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and more. This universal compatibility allows you to seamlessly switch between different AI tools.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the difference between skills and simple prompts?',
        answer: 'Skills offer significant advantages over simple prompts: 1) Reusability - install once, use everywhere; 2) Complexity - support multi-step workflows; 3) Quality - tested and scored; 4) Updates - automatic updates via CLI. Simple prompts require copy-pasting each time and are difficult to maintain.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I create my own skills?',
        answer: 'Absolutely! You can create custom skills following the Agent Skill standard. A skill typically includes a SKILL.md file (describing capabilities and usage scenarios), necessary code files, and configuration. Once created, you can submit it to the Awesome OpenClawSkills list to share with the community.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the skill loading priority?',
        answer: 'OpenClawSkills loads skills in the following priority (from highest to lowest): 1) Workspace level - current project\'s skills/ directory; 2) Global level - ~/.openclaw/skills/ directory; 3) Bundled level - built-in OpenClawSkills. This allows you to override global skill configurations at the project level.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I update installed skills?',
        answer: 'You can easily update skills using ClawdHub CLI. Run `clawdhub update <skill-name>` to update a specific skill, or run `clawdhub update --all` to update all installed skills. The CLI will automatically check for the latest version and perform the update.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How is skill security ensured?',
        answer: 'Community skills go through a review process, but we recommend checking the skill\'s source code and permission requirements before installation. OpenClawSkills will request confirmation before performing sensitive operations. For enterprise environments, we recommend distributing security-reviewed skill versions internally.',
